A [**Waystones**](https://modrinth.com/mod/waystones) addon that enhances the waystone selection menu with a variety of features :
- scroll bar for waystones
- search box (clearable with right click)
- sorting modes
- switch back to old UI
- extra waystone informations holding CTRL while hovering a waystone button
- full parity with the old menu
- ability to drag and drop waystones to swap them (swap because it's a limitation with the waystones mod)
- enhanced accessibility
